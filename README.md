## 💡 About the project
> This project requires setting up a Linux operating system from scratch in a virtual machine. The project aims to teach students how to configure an operating system and understand the various steps necessary to make it secure and functional. In addition, you will learn important concepts of IT security, such as user account management, firewall configuration, and system monitoring.

## 📝 Explanation of what I used in this project

### Virtual Box
- VirtualBox is a virtualization product from Oracle that enables users to expand their computer resources and perform virtualization.
- Virtualization allows users to make more efficient use of their computer resources, by running multiple virtual machines with different operating systems and configurations on a single physical computer. This can save money, reduce energy consumption, and increase flexibility and scalability
### Debian
- Debian is a fully open-source operating system officially maintained by the Debian Project, which also receives support from other individuals and organizations around the world. Debian is particularly well-known for its package management system, called APT, which allows for relatively easy updates from previous versions, effortless installation of new packages, and removal of old packages.
- The name 'Debian' comes from the names of its founders, Ian Murdock and his wife Debra
### Sudo
- The 'sudo' command is used in the Linux operating system to allow regular users to have the privileges of another user and perform specific tasks within the system.
- With 'sudo', users can safely perform these tasks in a way that can be controlled by the superuser or administrator.
- This helps to maintain the security of the system while allowing authorized users to perform necessary actions.
### SSH
- It is a protocol that ensures secure and dynamic exchange of information between a client and a remote server.
- The process is capable of encrypting files sent to the server directory, ensuring that changes and data transfers are carried out in the most secure manner possible.
### UFW
- It is an open-source solution built in Python and distributed under the GNU (General Public License).
- It is a 'friendly' version of the powerful iptables, which means it is more accessible to beginners or those unfamiliar with Information Security.
- The application is capable of doing everything that iptables can do, but in an easier way. Therefore, it is robust enough to be an excellent option for systems where security is a priority.
### Cron
- Cron is a Linux command that allows scheduling tasks to be performed in the future, either hours later or on another day.
- With this configuration, the server will execute any process on the specified day and time, respecting the appropriate queue of jobs that has been designed.
- It is widely used by IT professionals who need to maintain uninterrupted routines of analysis, monitoring, and inspection.
### APPArmor
- AppArmor is a Mandatory Access Control system built on top of the Linux Security Modules (LSM) interface.
- In practice, the kernel consults AppArmor before each system call to determine if the process is authorized to perform the given operation. Through this mechanism, AppArmor confines programs to a limited set of resources.
- In other words, it allows developers to restrict the actions that processes can take.

## 🛠️ Machine configuration
> I will provide a link to a Notion page that explains the step-by-step process for configuring the Linux operating system in a virtual machine. Please note that the content on the page is in Brazilian Portuguese.
